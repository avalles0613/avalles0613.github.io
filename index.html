            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a hardworking student passionate about software engineering and game development,

            <h2>Problem statement</h2>
            <p> Blackboard often fails to accurately display assignment due dates, which leads to confusion among students and 
                increases the likelihood of missed submissions. This inconsistency makes it difficult for students to plan their 
                schedules effectively and stay organized throughout the semester.</p>

            The affinity diagram organizes ideas for an assignment-tracking app into four 
            groups: product ideas, development hurdles, marketing strategies, and essential features. 
            It shows the brainstorming process behind designing an app that helps students manage and stay 
            reminded of upcoming assignments.
